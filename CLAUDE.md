# MTB Skills Assessment — Project Instructions

## App being built

A coach-facing skill assessment tool for NICA MTB coaches. See ROADMAP.md for phases.

**Tech stack:**
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS (ES modules), Vite as build tool — no framework (no React/Vue)
- **Build:** `npm run build` → `dist/` → deployed as static files
- **Dev server:** `npm run dev` → localhost:5173 with hot reload
- **Backend (Phase 4):** Python FastAPI, Docker (python:3.12-slim), Cloud Run on GCP
- **Repo structure:** Monorepo — frontend in `src/`, backend in `backend/` when added
- **Offline-first throughout all phases** — practices are frequently out of cell service
- **No sequential IDs** — use UUIDs everywhere (multi-device merge safety)
- **Data model must not lock out multi-tenant** — all records carry `team_id` and `coach_id` from Phase 1

**Monorepo structure:**
```
mtb-skills/
  src/              ← Vite frontend source
    rubric.js       ← rubric data as ES module
    storage.js      ← data access abstraction
    log.js          ← in-app logger
  tests/
    unit/           ← Vitest unit tests (JS logic)
    e2e/            ← Playwright e2e tests (browser/UI)
  backend/          ← Phase 4: Python FastAPI (not yet)
  .github/
    workflows/      ← CI/CD pipelines
  dist/             ← Vite build output (gitignored)
  index.html        ← Vite entry point at repo root
  vite.config.js
  package.json
```

**Deployment:**
- **Phase 1–3:** GitHub Pages — GitHub Actions builds `dist/` on push to `main`, deploys to Pages
- **Phase 4 frontend:** GCS bucket or Firebase Hosting — same `dist/` output, different deploy target in workflow
- **Phase 4 backend:** Docker image → GCP Artifact Registry → Cloud Run (serverless, scales to zero)
- **Phase 2c:** Add `vite-plugin-pwa` for service worker + manifest generation
- Live URL: https://ashaber.github.io/mtb-skills/

**Definition of Done — Phase 1:**
- [ ] `index.html` exists at repo root and is the app entry point
- [ ] App is live at https://ashaber.github.io/mtb-skills/
- [ ] Opens and functions correctly on Android (Chrome)
- [ ] Opens and functions correctly on iOS (Safari)
- [ ] All Phase 1 features working:
  - [ ] Add and manage athletes (roster)
  - [ ] Log an observation (athlete → skill → level 1–5 → session date)
  - [ ] View observation history per athlete per skill
  - [ ] Confirm a skill level (separate from raw observations)
  - [ ] Trail readiness view computed from confirmed levels
  - [ ] JSON export (full data download, including log)
- [ ] Data persists across page reloads (localStorage)
- [ ] App works with no network connection
- [ ] No sequential IDs — all records use UUIDs
- [ ] All records carry `team_id` and `coach_id`
- [ ] Playwright tests pass: app loads, localStorage persists, offline mode works
- [ ] Playwright tests pass on Chromium and WebKit viewports
- [ ] Manual verify on real Android device (Chrome)
- [ ] Manual verify on real iOS device (Safari)
- [ ] README.md updated to reflect current feature status
- [ ] ROADMAP.md phase status updated (mark phase complete, note any scope changes)
- [ ] Phase tagged in git: `git tag v1.0` (increment per phase)
- [ ] JSON export verified: exported file re-imports cleanly with no data loss

**Key files:**
- `RUBRIC.md` — authoritative rubric content; card content is master. Do not duplicate here.
- `ROADMAP.md` — phased build plan. Do not duplicate here.
- `src/rubric.js` — rubric data as ES module; all views import from here
- `src/storage.js` — data access abstraction; swap this to change backend
- `src/log.js` — in-app logger; ring buffer to localStorage + console
- `app/schema.md` — data model documentation
- `vite.config.js` — Vite configuration
- `package.json` — npm scripts: dev, build, test

**Assessment model:**
- Raw observations are immutable append-only: `{ athlete_id, skill, level_observed, session_date }`
- Confirmed level is separate: coach explicitly sets it when consistency gate is met
- Consistency gate is coach judgment — app surfaces history, never auto-promotes
- Trail readiness is always computed client-side from confirmed levels + `TRAIL_MINIMUMS` in `rubric.js`

## Build Guidelines

### Test-driven workflow
- Every module requires test cases before shipping
- Write tests first — confirm they fail — then code until passing
- Never skip tests to move faster
- All tests must pass before a feature is considered done

### Test tooling
**Vitest** — unit tests for JS logic (storage, rubric calculations, trail readiness)
- Lives in `tests/unit/`
- Run with `npm run test`
- Native ES module support — zero config with Vite
- Mocks `localStorage` cleanly

**Playwright (Python)** — e2e/UI tests for full browser flows
- Lives in `tests/e2e/`
- Run with `pytest tests/e2e/`
- Exit code 0 = all pass, non-zero = failure — safe for CI

### What to test (minimum per feature)
- App loads at root URL
- Feature renders and accepts input correctly
- localStorage persists across page reload (simulate by reloading the page context)
- App functions correctly with network set to offline (`context.set_offline(True)`)
- Mobile viewport: test at 390×844 (iPhone 14) and 412×915 (Android)

### Browsers to cover
- Chromium (Android Chrome proxy)
- WebKit (iOS Safari proxy)
- Real device test on Android and iOS before marking Phase DOD complete

---

## Branching and Release Standards

### Branch workflow
- All work happens on feature branches — never commit directly to `main`
- Branch naming: `phase1/feature-name` or `sprint1/feature-name`
- Merge to `main` via Pull Request only
- PR description must list which DOD items are being checked off
- Do not merge a PR with failing Playwright tests

### PR checklist (every PR)
- [ ] Vitest unit tests written and passing (`npm run test`)
- [ ] Playwright e2e tests passing on Chromium + WebKit (`pytest tests/e2e/`)
- [ ] No dead code or commented-out code
- [ ] `src/log.js` used for all logging — no bare `console.*` in app code
- [ ] DOD items addressed are noted in PR description

### Releases
- Tag `main` at the completion of each phase: `git tag v1.0`, `v2.0`, etc.
- Provides a clean rollback point before the next phase begins
- Update README.md and ROADMAP.md before tagging

## Logging

PWAs run in the browser — no stdout, no server. Use `app/log.js` for all logging.

### Pattern (`app/log.js`)
```javascript
const MAX_ENTRIES = 200;

const log = {
  info:  (msg, meta = {}) => _write('info',  msg, meta),
  warn:  (msg, meta = {}) => _write('warn',  msg, meta),
  error: (msg, meta = {}) => _write('error', msg, meta),
};

function _write(level, msg, meta) {
  console[level]?.(msg, meta);  // visible in DevTools during development

  // Persist to localStorage ring buffer (survives page reload)
  const entries = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('mtb_log') || '[]');
  entries.push({ level, msg, ...meta, ts: new Date().toISOString() });
  if (entries.length > MAX_ENTRIES) entries.splice(0, entries.length - MAX_ENTRIES);
  localStorage.setItem('mtb_log', JSON.stringify(entries));
}

export default log;
```

### Rules
- Import and use `log` from `app/log.js` everywhere — never use `console.*` directly in app code
- Log is included in JSON export so a coach can email it for field debugging
- Never log PII (athlete names should use IDs in log entries)
- Ring buffer — max 200 entries, oldest dropped first

### What to log
- App init: version, storage key counts
- Each user action: feature, athlete_id, skill, outcome
- Storage read/write errors with context
- Any caught exception: message + stack

## Debugging Tooling

### Desktop (development)
- **Chrome DevTools** — Application tab: localStorage, service worker, cache, manifest. Network tab: offline toggle. Console: all log output.

### Real Android
- **Chrome remote debugging** — plug in via USB, open `chrome://inspect` on desktop Chrome → full DevTools on the phone's live session

### Real iOS
- **Safari Web Inspector** — iPhone: Settings → Safari → Advanced → Web Inspector on. Mac: Safari → Develop → [your device]. Full DevTools on phone's Safari session.
- Requires a Mac for iOS remote debugging — no equivalent on Windows natively

### Service Worker (Phase 2c)
- Chrome DevTools → Application → Service Workers: register/unregister, force update, offline simulation
- `chrome://serviceworker-internals` for low-level state

### Playwright
- `page.on('console', ...)` — capture log output in tests
- `page.on('pageerror', ...)` — catch uncaught JS errors
- `--headed` flag to watch tests run in a real browser window
- `playwright show-trace` — timeline of every action, screenshot, network request
